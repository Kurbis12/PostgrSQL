# Sometimes we make fast tables and don't think what data type we need or we just make a mistake.

# To know if we can change data type use:
SELECT CAST(column_name AS DECIMAL ) From table_name  

# For example we have table (test_table) and column named (size)(and size column data type is text and we need change that to integer

alter table test_table
alter column size type decimal(5,2) using (size::decimal(5,2))
